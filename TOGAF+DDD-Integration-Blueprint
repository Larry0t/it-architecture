TOGAF + DDD Integration Blueprint for Solution Architecture

🎯 Overall Idea
	•	TOGAF provides the process, governance, stakeholders, and enterprise alignment.
	•	DDD provides the domain modeling, boundaries, and system decomposition.

⁠Use TOGAF to navigate the architecture lifecycle, and use DDD to make the architecture correct and maintainable.

⸻

1️⃣ Phase A: Architecture Vision (TOGAF) + DDD Problem Exploration

Your objectives in this phase
	•	Understand the problem
	•	Understand the business
	•	Establish the strategic direction
	•	Identify where the domain complexity actually is

TOGAF Deliverables
	•	Architecture Vision
	•	High-level Requirements
	•	Stakeholder Map
	•	Value Streams
	•	Business Motivation

DDD Activities
	•	Event Storming (high-level “big picture”)
	•	Identify domain events, actors, commands
	•	Quick identification of subdomains:
	•	Core
	•	Supporting
	•	Generic

Outputs to Carry Forward
	•	A rough map of domain complexity
	•	Understanding of what must be architected carefully (core domain) vs. what can be commodity

2️⃣ Phase B: Business Architecture (TOGAF) + DDD Domain Modeling

TOGAF Deliverables
	•	Business Capability Map
	•	Business Process Models
	•	Business Architecture Baseline & Target

DDD Activities
	•	Detailed collaborative modeling with domain experts
	•	Identify bounded contexts
	•	Extract context responsibilities
	•	Define ubiquitous language per context
	•	Refine subdomain-to-context mapping

Outputs
	•	Clear bounded contexts with domain purpose
	•	Context-to-capability alignment (TOGAF ←→ DDD)

This phase is the bridge between the TOGAF business world and the DDD domain world.

⸻

3️⃣ Phase C: Information / Application Architecture (TOGAF) + DDD Context Maps

TOGAF Deliverables
	•	Data Architecture Models
	•	Application Portfolio View
	•	Target Application Architecture
	•	Application Services Catalogue

DDD Tactics
	•	Create Context Maps:
	•	Upstream/downstream definition
	•	Shared Kernel, Customer/Supplier, ACLs, Anti-corruption layers, Conformist, …
	•	Define aggregates, entities, and value objects inside each bounded context
	•	Define context APIs (commands, queries, events)

Outputs
	•	Application architecture organized around domain boundaries, not technologies
	•	Clear integration topology between bounded contexts
	•	Well-defined APIs and event flows

This is where many architects accidentally create distributed monoliths.
DDD keeps the architectural boundaries clean.

⸻

4️⃣ Phase D: Technology Architecture (TOGAF) + DDD Runtime Modeling

TOGAF Deliverables
	•	Technology Stack
	•	Infrastructure Patterns
	•	Platform Architecture
	•	Cloud Reference Architectures
	•	Security, Network, Observability Architecture

DDD-aligned Activities
	•	Map bounded contexts to:
	•	Microservices
	•	Service modules
	•	Serverless functions
	•	Event streams
	•	Define deployment topology for each context
	•	Define transaction boundaries per aggregate
	•	Define data ownership per bounded context
	•	Define events as first-class integration mechanism

Outputs
	•	Technology decisions aligned with domain boundaries
	•	Runtime architecture that respects DDD aggregates and context APIs
	•	Cloud-native decomposition that avoids shared databases

⸻

5️⃣ ADM Phases E–G: Migration Planning, Implementation Governance

TOGAF Work
	•	Roadmaps
	•	Transition architectures
	•	Work packages
	•	Governance checkpoints
	•	Compliance assessments

DDD Support
	•	Define context-by-context migration sequencing
	•	Stabilize the core domain first
	•	Create Anti-Corruption Layers during migration
	•	Define decomposition path from monolith → modular → microservices (if needed)

Outputs
	•	A roadmap that preserves bounded-context boundaries
	•	Controlled integration and decoupling
	•	Evolutionary architecture over big-bang redesign

⸻

6️⃣ ADM Phase H: Architecture Change Management

TOGAF Work
	•	Change impact analysis
	•	Architecture reviews
	•	Continuous alignment with business strategy

DDD Complement
	•	Evolve bounded contexts as the business changes
	•	Update context maps to reflect new realities
	•	Refactor aggregates carefully as domain language matures
	•	Monitor integration points for coupling regression

Outputs
	•	A “living architecture” that evolves with the domain
	•	Prevents domain-layer erosion over time

⸻

🧭 Cross-Cutting Practices: Glue Between TOGAF and DDD

1. Governance (TOGAF) + Decision Records (DDD/modern practice)

Use ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) to:
	•	Capture domain decisions
	•	Capture context boundaries
	•	Capture integration patterns
	•	Capture technology choices

TOGAF governance boards can review ADRs.

⸻

2. Capability Mapping + Domain Boundaries
	•	Capabilities explain what the business does
	•	Bounded contexts explain how the business works internally

Mapping capabilities → bounded contexts creates:
	•	Clean architecture
	•	Avoids spaghetti integration
	•	Enables modular development teams

⸻

3. Portfolio Architecture + Subdomain Classification

TOGAF portfolio views should align with DDD:
	•	Core subdomains → most investment
	•	Supporting subdomains → selective investment
	•	Generic subdomains → commodity, buy not build

⸻

🏁 End Result: What This Blueprint Gives You

You get:
	•	Governance and enterprise alignment (TOGAF)
	•	Deep correctness and modularity (DDD)
	•	Clean system boundaries
	•	Stable APIs
	•	Evolving architecture
	•	A strategic roadmap
	•	A domain-aligned technology platform
	•	A clear separation between business concerns and technical mechanisms

You avoid:
	•	Distributed monoliths
	•	Random microservices
	•	Architecture drift
	•	Integration chaos
	•	“Archi-babble” without substance
	•	Overly complex enterprise frameworks without connection to reality

✔️ If you want, I can produce:
	1.	A one-page visual blueprint (diagram) integrating TOGAF + DDD
	2.	A sample template set (bounded context inventory, context map, capability ↔ context matrix)
	3.	A short “playbook” version for teams to follow
